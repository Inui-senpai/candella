## What makes Candella different?

- **Release compatibility**: Candella's release cycle syncs up with feature releases of Unscripted and the Ren'Py SDK, respectively.
- **Responsive feedback**: [AliceOS][aliceos] follows a strict release schedule and doesn't update as quickly with bug fixes or improvements, Candella gets feedback from the public as well as playtesters in the [Unscripted Playtesting Program][uvn-beta].
- **Targeted for Unscripted**: Candella will add new features and improvements that will be helpful for Unscripted, such as native support for the NadiaVM language.
- **Simplified app development**: Candella's application framework extensions make it easier to develop apps quickly without fiddling through delegate calls, making projects from scratch, or remembering what keys are valid. There's even a curated project repository that players can download from and where developers can upload releases to.
