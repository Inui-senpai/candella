# Technical Preview 2 (1.0.0)
- Setup assistant has been completely rewritten from the ground-up. Now supports dynamic font changes and a large font mode.
- Stop errors have been rewritten and are now dynamically called using `ThrowASError()`
- Default backgrounds have changed.
- OEM settings have been adjusted to use the new Setup assistant and now use hardcoded values for font files instead of dynamic assignments.
- Issue where Ren'Py projects crash upon loading an AliceOS dialog from a save file in OEM font mode has been resolved (#22).
