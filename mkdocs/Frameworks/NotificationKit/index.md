#  NotificationKit Overview

**NotificationKit** is the official API set for sending notifications in AliceOS. Notifications include the following:

- [Banners](01-banner.md): Temporary popups from the top of the screen that can be acted upon or dismissed.
- [Alerts](02-alerts.md): Full-screen dialog boxes that require user input immediately.
- Sounds: Sounds that play to incidate something has occured.

## About this documentation section

The documentation provided on NotificationKit does _not_ cover usage of their implementation with apps. Rather, the documentation covers the screens in use and how they can be called without needing Applets. This kind of scenario applies in cases where the AliceOS base only includes NotificationKit.

If you wish to create an app that makes use of NotificationKit, please consult the Apps documentation under "Sending Notifications".
