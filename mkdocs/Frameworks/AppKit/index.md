# AppKit Overview

**AppKit** is the official API responsible for making apps on AliceOS. AppKit contains the necessary pieces of information to create fun and safe applications that work directly with AliceOS.

## About this documentation section

This section will cover most of the Python class documentation and backend information about AppKit and apps built with it.

For more information on how to build an app for AliceOS, see the [Develop Apps](../../Develop-Apps) section.

!!! warning
    AliceOS's AppKit should _not_ be confused with Apple's AppKit for macOS, the interface kit responsible for creating macOS applications.
